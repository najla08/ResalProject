We can implement a message broker and distributed task queue for asynchronous processing to avoid the timeout request.
The client will run the API app and will issue a request which will be received by the message broker. The message broker such as RabbitMQ acts as a mediate between the client and distributed task queue's worker will add the tasks (messages) to the queue and send them to workers. The distributed task queue such as Celery can have multiple workers perform several tasks at a time to provide real-time processing. Each worker can take their time to perform the provided task and return the response.
